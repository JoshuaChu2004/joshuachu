# Phoenix's Nest of Everything
A collection of **homebrew content** created for the Dungeons & Dragons RPG System. If you are familiar with the book of a similar (if not more vulgar) title, you'll see many familiar faces. This collection serves to document and display classes, subclasses, items, spells, races, features, and house rulings that I feel are ready to be used more officially.

Everything here has received apt amount of playtesting, whether in full campaigns or one-shots, and I will likely not make many changes to existing content unless I see a great need to. However, this is still not official material. It is not endorsed by Wizards of the Coast, nor should you use it in any D&D setting without first getting the approval of the DM and the table.
