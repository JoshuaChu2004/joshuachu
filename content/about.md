Born in San Jose to immigrant parents, I grew up immersed in technology â€” but it was the **interactivity of computer games** that first inspired me. By third grade, I had already set my sights on becoming a game developer.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, where I serve as an officer in the **UCSB Game Development Club**. I lead projects ranging from narrative experiments to mechanics-driven prototypes, organize events, and mentor new members in game design and development.

In Fall 2025, I released **Into the Depths**, a solo-developed roguelike deckbuilder in Godot featuring a persistent deck system to encourage strategic play. I also led development on **Spirit**, a Unity-based 2D RPG with dual protagonists and hybrid mechanics like rhythm-based combat and word-building spells. Though on hold, it shaped my growth as a systems designer and team lead.

Currently, I'm a **Software Engineering Intern** at VBO Tickets, contributing to a platform-wide front-end upgrade. I developed a new WebGL-powered seat map using PixiJS, designed to render up to 100,000 seats simultaneously with smooth performance â€” a major scalability improvement for large venues. I also implemented a dynamic sidebar using JavaScript, C#, HTML, and CSS, enabling users to sort and select seats in real time by price, value, or availability.

I'm passionate about designing immersive, meaningful experiences where engineering meets storytelling â€” whether through gameplay, narrative, or interactive systems.
